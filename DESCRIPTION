Description: Presenting a program's output together with its code lets you show
    the program to others without having to reload large datasets or execute
    long-running processes. When we're unable to work in 'RMarkdown' documents,
    we do this by including program output as comments in plain 'R' scripts.
    This 'RStudio add-in' automates that by inserting the console output of the
    last expression as a comment, along with a datestamp showing when the code
    was last run for reportability.
