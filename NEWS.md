# carboncopy 0.1.2

- Add HH:MM to the output's timestamp.

# carboncopy 0.1.1

- `cc_insert_lastvalue()` invisibly returns the original `.Last.value` so that 
  if the user needs to re-insert the comment due to wrong Console Pane width, 
  they don't have to re-run the code to get a new copy of the output.

# carboncopy 0.1.0

- Initial version.
